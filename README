# Grover's Algorithm for Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)

This project demonstrates the application of **Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm** to solve a simple **3-variable SAT (Boolean Satisfiability)** problem using Qiskit.

## 📌 Problem Statement

We solve the SAT formula:

```
(x1 OR x2 OR NOT x3) AND (NOT x1 OR x2 OR x3)
```

using Grover's algorithm to find satisfying assignments for the boolean variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.

## 🎯 Objective

To find inputs (bitstrings) that satisfy the formula using Grover’s quantum search approach, which provides a quadratic speedup over classical brute-force algorithms.
